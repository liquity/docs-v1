Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw [interest-free](https://app.gitbook.com/@liquity/s/liquity-docs/faq/borrowing#how-can-you-offer-borrowing-at-a-0-interest-rate) loans against Ether used as [collateral](faq/borrowing.md#what-do-you-mean-by-collateral). Loans are paid out in LUSD (a USD pegged stablecoin) and need to maintain a [minimum collateral ratio](faq/borrowing.md#what-is-the-minimum-collateral-ratio-mcr-and-the-recommended-collateral-ratio) of 110%.

In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. Learn more about these mechanisms in our documentation.&#x20;

Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free.
