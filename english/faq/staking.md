# LQTY Staking

All of the revenue the protocol makes is diverted to LQTY stakers. By staking LQTY you are entitled to a pro-rate share of it.

### How does staking work in Liquity?&#x20;

To start staking all you need to do is deposit your LQTY token to the Liquity staking contract. Once done you will start earning a pro rata share of the borrowing and redemption fees in LUSD and ETH.

### How much will my staked LQTY earn?&#x20;

Your LQTY stake will earn a share of the fees equal to your share of the total LQTY staked, at the instant the fee occurred.

### Is there a lock-up period?

No, you can withdraw your staked funds at any time.

### Can I stake LUSD?&#x20;

You can only stake LQTY tokens. LUSD can be deposited into the [Stability Pool](stability-pool-and-liquidations.md#what-is-the-stability-pool) instead.&#x20;

### Are staked LQTY tokens used to backstop the system (like Maker) or for governance?&#x20;

No, staked LQTY are not used to backstop the Liquity system and are not used for governance as there is no Liquity governance.&#x20;
