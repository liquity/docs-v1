# Frontend SDK

A technical system summary including contract descriptions, function descriptions, and more is available in the [**Liquity README**](https://github.com/liquity/beta/blob/main/README.md).&#x20;

Our technical documentation (SDK) and middleware library enables you to build your own Liquity frontend or integrate Liquity with your existing service, abstracting away some the underlying contract calls.

It consists of two libraries, written in TypeScript:&#x20;

| [**lib-base**](https://github.com/liquity/dev/tree/main/packages/lib-base)     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Common interfaces and classes shared by the other lib- packages.               |
| [API Reference](https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/docs/sdk/lib-base.md) |

| [**lib-ethers**](https://github.com/liquity/dev/tree/main/packages/lib-ethers)                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  [Ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/)-based middleware that can read Liquity state and send transactions.  |
| [API Reference](https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/docs/sdk/lib-ethers.md)                                        |
